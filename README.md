Advanced Pooling System
=======================

Advanced Pooling System is an out-of-the-box object pooling system which along with the ease of use rapidly increases performance in games. It enables you to significantly reduce memory allocation, garbage collection and you can seamlessly create thousands of objects and particle effects. We wanted to make it more user friendly, so the basic methods like Instantiate, Destroy, etc. can be replaced by Advanced Pooling System's InstantiateAPS, DestroyAPS respectively.

 Features:
=======================
- Pool multiple prefab types
- Supports pooling of gameobjects, sounds & particle effects
- Pre-instantiated objects
- Expandable pools to provide extra instances when necessary
 
How To Pool
=======================
Instantiating From Pool:

    PoolingSystem pS = PoolingSystem.Instance;

    pS.InstantiateAPS("prefabName");
    pS.InstantiateAPS("prefabName", _position, _rotation); 
    pS.InstantiateAPS("prefabName", _position, _rotation, parent);


Destroying/Recycling Pooled Object:

    myPrefab.DestroyAPS();
